        <h1>University of Nebraska Engineers Without Borders</h1>
        <p>I have been a member of the University of Nebraska student chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB-NU) for my entire collegiate career. The chapter is responsible for a bridge project in Zambia and a solar panel project in Madagascar, as well as a number of local outreach events and programs.</p>
        <p>During my time at EWB, I have been treasurer, fundraising lead and manager of the \"Nebraska Team\", and vice president.</p>
        <p>This page and its subpages details EWB-NUs and its projects, events, and my involvement in the organization.</p>
